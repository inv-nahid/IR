MNIST Digit Recognition
Overview
MNIST Digit Recognition is a machine learning project that trains a neural network to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow. The model achieves high accuracy through a deep learning approach, leveraging a sequential neural network with dense layers for digit classification.
Features

Digit Classification: Accurately classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
Neural Network: Uses a sequential model with dense layers, ReLU, and softmax activation.
High Accuracy: Achieves ~97% accuracy on the test set after 15 epochs.
Data Visualization: Visualizes MNIST digit images using Matplotlib.
Model Saving: Saves the trained model for future inference (mnist_num_reader.keras).

Tech Stack

Python: Core language for model development.
TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for building and training the neural network.
NumPy: For numerical computations and array operations.
Matplotlib: For visualizing MNIST digit images.
Jupyter Notebook: Environment for running the project interactively.

Prerequisites

Python (v3.8+): For running the application.
Pip: Package manager for installing dependencies.
Jupyter Notebook: For executing the notebook.
Git: For version control (optional).

Evaluate Model: Evaluates the model on the test set, displaying validation loss and accuracy.
Visualize Results: Displays sample digit images and predictions using Matplotlib.
Save Model: Saves the trained model as mnist_num_reader.keras for future use.

Model Details

Architecture: Sequential model with a Flatten layer, two Dense layers (128 neurons, ReLU activation), and an output Dense layer (10 neurons, softmax activation).
Optimizer: Adam optimizer for efficient gradient descent.
Loss Function: Sparse categorical crossentropy for multi-class classification.
Training: 15 epochs with a validation split of 0.2, achieving 97.05% test accuracy.

Future Improvements
